Code for simulating the CA1 neuron model used in figure 2 of the article:
A circuit mechanism for systems memory consolidation
Michiel Remme, Urs Bergmann, Susanne Schreiber, Henning Sprekeler, Richard Kempter

To run the code both MATLAB and NEURON need to be installed.

Before running the code, the MOD files in the directory _mod need to be compiled with the application 'mknrndll' that is included with NEURON. This will create the executable 'special' in a subdirectory of _mod. This executable should be copied manually to the same directory as 'neuron_Fig_2.hoc'.

The simulation can be started from Matlab by running the script 'matlab_Fig_2_run.m'.
For plotting results from a previously run simulation, run the script 'matlab_Fig_2_plot.m'
